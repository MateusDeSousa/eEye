Project developed at the Apple Developer Academy Foundation with final project of completion of the course.

Project developed following the guidelines of application development second to Apple.
The big Big Idea was in the health area, where my team had the perception of performing pre-vision tests through a mobile platform. Apart from the we saw some diseases that we could use within this solution we collected data for inclusion within the APP.
The eEye application was born, able to preadinosticar visual diseases like Metamorfopsia, Astigmatism and Daltonismo. below is a few prints of the application.
